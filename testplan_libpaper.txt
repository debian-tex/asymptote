After a change, repeat a "sensible" subset of already successful
tests. When all is supposed to be finished, repeat the whole set.

For a test to pass, the following must work: 

Install, test papersize settings, remove, install, test papersize
settings, purge

DEBIAN_FRONTEND must be readline; messages must be readable and make
sense
