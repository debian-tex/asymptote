After a change, repeat a "sensible" subset of already successful
tests. When all is supposed to be finished, repeat the whole set.

For a test to pass, the following must work: 

Install, test papersize settings, remove, install, test papersize
settings, purge

DEBIAN_FRONTEND must be readline; messages must be readable and make
sense

3) config.ps change: a4 stanza has been moved downwards below letter
4) Error 3) is not by itself reproducible. However, when installing,
removing and installing again, each papersize change is reported.  

5) (with frontend dialog:) Here a bug showed up, but that must have
been from a bad build of texlive-bin.: 
     Before the dialog to choose binaries is shown, an other prompt
     tells me that dvipdfmx.cfg has been changed. However, there are
     no non-whitespace differences
This is no longer reproducible, however there is at least a cosmetic
problem:  dvipdfmx as shipped with TL 2009 contains
p  a4
with two spaces, whereas texconfig-sys only puts one space there.

6) "unrelated" problem: There is no call at all to install
pdftexconfig.tex after removing the "resurrect" code

7) Although Monarch is not possible, the fact that the settings are
different causes the debconf question to be asked, and then Monarch is
fed to texconfig. Moreover, it looks like there is an "env" call
somewhere. 

8) forgot to db_subst one info.  Continue checking, since this is
unrelated to coding logic.

9) maybe just cosmetics: It asks about the non-papersize change.
Maybe declaring the sid md5sum as default fixes this?
