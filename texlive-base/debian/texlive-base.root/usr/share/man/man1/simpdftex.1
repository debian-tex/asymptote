.SH NAME
simpdftex \- create pdf files via latex-dvips-gs instead of pdflatex
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simpdftex
\fIformatname\fR
[options]
\fItex-or-dvi-file\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
simpdftex is a way to do pdf{e}{la}tex without having pdf{e}{la}tex. It needs a
working TeX environment and ghostscript. Since pdf{e}{la}tex cannot handle
insertion of .eps graphics, simpdftex gives an alternative. The output for both
systems is comparable.
.PP
simpdftex compiles the file with {LA}TeX, processes the DVI file with dvips into
PostScript and uses gs to produce pdf (with ps2pdf). There is finegrained
control over the resulting filename and the options with which dvips produces
the PostScript intermediary file.
.PP
Dvips will call Metafont to produce bitmaps or include PostScript .pfb files
depending on the flags. See below.
.PP
Default settings is normal name, maximal use of pfb's, just like pdf{la}tex,
in other words, "pdftex file.tex" and "altpdftex file.tex" both produce an
output file file.pdf. For pdftex, output options are controlled by pdftex.cfg,
for altpdftext by config.ps (unless \fB\-\-pdf\fR is given).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
formatname
.IP
Specifies the format to be used
.TP
tex\-or\-dvi\-file
.IP
If a .dvi file is given, skip the TeX process. Otherwise, TeX
the input file, dvips the resulting dvi file and ps2pdf the
resulting ps file
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Display this message and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-echo\-version\fR
.IP
Do not echo location and version of this script. Does not exit
so can be used tochange info to the output of a real run
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
.IP
Add some debug output
.TP
\fB\-\-extendedname\fR
.IP
Depending on the mode, adds intermediary extensions to the
output filename. If the mode is \fB\-\-pdf\fR, .pdfmode is added. If
the mode is \fB\-\-maxpk\fR, ,maxpk is added and if the mode is
\fB\-\-maxpfb\fR, .maxpfb is added. Example:
.IP
tex\-or\-dvi\-file\-basename.maxpfb.pdf
.TP
\fB\-\-maxpk\fR
.IP
Use Metafont bitmaps (pk files) when possible. Only real
PostScript fonts (like Times Roman) are included as
PostScript fonts. All other fonts are included as bitmaps
for the default printer resolution. This options produces
optimal results for the chosen printer.
For file contents (not name) equivalent to:
\fB\-\-dvipsopts\fR "\-Ppk"
.TP
\fB\-\-maxpfb\fR
.IP
Use PostScript pfb files whenever possible. This produces
optimal results for the screen.
For file contents (not name) equivalent to:
\fB\-\-dvipsopts\fR "\-Poutline"
If any font is included as TeX pk bitmap, it is rendered
at the default resolution.
.TP
\fB\-\-pdf\fR
.IP
Select .pdfmode extension for the output file name if
\fB\-\-extendedname\fR has been set. Use printer definition
config.pdf. For file contents (not name) equivalent to
\fB\-\-dvipsopts\fR "\-Ppdf"
Note that the default config.pdf assumes resolution 8000
for bitmaps and bitmap generation fails at this resolution
because there exists no known mode for that resolution.
.TP
\fB\-\-default\fR
.IP
Select no extension for the output file name, even if
\fB\-\-extendedfilename\fR has been set. Use standard printer
definition config.ps. For file contents (not name) equivalent
to:
\fB\-\-dvipsopts\fR "" \fB\-\-noextendedname\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-dvipsopts\fR
.IP
Give arbitrary arguments to dvips, e.g.
\fB\-\-dvipsopts\fR "\-M"
Sets extension for \fB\-\-extendedfilename\fR to .custom. \fB\-\-dvipsopts\fR
overrides other flags that set dvipsopts.
.TP
\fB\-\-extratexopts\fR
.IP
Give extra arbitrary arguments to tex, e.g.
\fB\-\-extratexopts\fR "\-\-interaction=nonstopmode"
Sets extra options for the tex command that is used.
.TP
\fB\-\-extradvipsopts\fR
.IP
Give extra arbitrary arguments to dvips, e.g.
\fB\-\-extradvipsopts\fR "\-M"
Sets extra options for dvips and does not set extension
or override other options. Options will be added to the end
of the options for dvips
.TP
\fB\-\-keep\-psfile\fR
.IP
After running dvips, copy the ps file over to the directory
where the tex file is, possibly overwriting a ps file
that is there. Use with caution, a ps file could be input
as well.
.TP
\fB\-\-tex\-path\fR
.IP
Give path of TeX binaries, use directory of this script
otherwise
.TP
\fB\-\-distiller\fR prog
.IP
Use a distiller different from ps2pdf which is the default.
Argument must be an executable or executable script that
gets called iwth two arguments: input file (PS) and output
file (PDF). E.g.:
\fB\-\-distiller=\fR/usr/local/alternate/bin/ps2pdf
\fB\-\-distiller\fR=\fIpstill\fR
Using this flag sets the distiller filter mode to off
.TP
\fB\-\-distiller\-filter\fR prog
.IP
Use a distiller executable or executable script which is
called with the PS input as standard input and which writes
the PDF output to standard output. E.g.:
\fB\-\-distiller\-filter\fR=\fIu\-psbuild\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-distiller\-path\fR
.IP
Give path needed by the distiller binary. This path is added
to the begin of you PATH environment before the distiller is
run. The reason is that for instance ps2pdf uses the path to
find gs and sets the path to something with /sw/bin at the
beginning.  Thus, installing gs from fink would make
/usr/local/bin/ps2pdf find another gs than intended. By giving
an empty path, the path is not changed before the distiller
program is run. The default is empty.
.TP
\fB\-\-outdir\fR dir
.IP
Write files here *if* our current directory is unwritable. This
mimicks the TEXMFOUTPUT environment variable of TeX, but
differently. The current dir becomes the value of \fB\-\-outdir\fR and
the directory where the old current dir is added to TEXINPUTS.
This is more robust for reading and locating files.
You can also set TEXMFOUTPUT instead, but with a disadvantage:
you will be running TeXin the current dir. And you will not be
able to read files in the outdir unless you also adapt
TEXINPUTS.
.PP
The defaults for the distiller are
.IP
Path addition: "/usr/local/bin"
Filter mode: "no"
Program: "ps2pdf13"
.PP
Later flags override settings of earlier flags.
