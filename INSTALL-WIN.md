# Building Asymptote with CMake (On Windows)

## Basic Requirements

### Required Dependencies
Ensure the following is installed:
- Visual Studio 2022+ or Visual Studio 2022+ build tools.
  - Both can be found at [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
- CMake
  - (Recommended way) Visual Studio/Visual Studio Build Tools provides bundled CMake as a selectable component
  - Otherwise, CMake can be found [here](https://cmake.org/)
- Python 3+
  - Available [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
- Perl on Windows
  - (Recommended way) Strawberry Perl is available at [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/).
  - (Not recommended due to license terms) ActiveState Perl is available [here](https://www.activestate.com/products/perl/).
- Ninja
  - (Recommended) Visual Studio/Visual Studio Build Tools provides bundled Ninja as part of CMake build tools
  - Otherwise, Ninja can be installed using winget by running `winget install Ninja-build.Ninja`.
  - If winget is not available, Ninja can be found [here](https://ninja-build.org/).
    If installing this way, ensure `ninja` is accessible from `PATH`.
  - (Untested) `ninja.exe` is bundled within a Strawberry Perl installation.

### Optional, but highly recommended dependencies
- A GCC-compatible C++ compiler (Optional, but highly recommended. See #installing-gcc-compatible-c++-compiler)
  - (Recommended way) [here](https://releases.llvm.org/).
  - (Untested) `g++.exe` is bundled within a Strawberry Perl installation.
  - (Untested) Visual Studio also provides clang tools as an installable component.
    If installing this way, ensure that `clang++.exe` is available.
- Vcpkg (Optional, but highly recommended. See #notes-on-dependency-management)
  - Can be found [here](https://vcpkg.io/).

### Dependencies for documentation generation (Required only for building a setup file)

Ensure [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/windows.html) is available on the system.
[MikTeX](https://miktex.org) is a possible substitute but is unsupported.

Building `asymptote.pdf` requires a UNIX system.

### Dependencies for building the setup file

The following is required for building the setup file:
- NSIS installer.
  - NSIS installer can be found [here](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download).

## For a quick start

If you are getting started and want a quick configuration, run `./quick-start-win32.ps1`.
This script automatically checks that you have vcpkg, and if not, clones and bootstraps vcpkg on your system.

Additionally, this script automatically locates your Visual Studio installation and
establishes all required environment variables.

## Notes on Dependency management

The recommended way is to use [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/).
See `INSTALL.md` for more details.
On windows, one may run

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```
to initialize vcpkg.
Make sure the environment `VCPKG_ROOT` points to where your vcpkg repository is at user or machine scope.

### For User scope
This can be done either by Start -> "Edit environment variables for your account" and then adding
VCPKG_ROOT entry, or by PowerShell,

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('VCPKG_ROOT', '<path to vcpkg>', 'User')
```

### For machine scope

Otherwise, you can also set VCPKG_ROOT for everyone on your machine.

## Using CMake

### Installing GCC-compatible C++ compiler

We (highly) suggest installing a GCC-compatible C++ compiler for preprocessing.
Our recommendation is to use clang/LLVM tools, available [here](https://releases.llvm.org/).
Once your compiler is installed, there are a few options.

- (Recommended) Ensure `clang++.exe` is available in `PATH` and leave `GCCCOMPAT_CXX_COMPILER_FOR_MSVC` unset.
  The build script will automatically try to locate `clang++.exe` or `g++.exe` in places 
  within `PATH`.
  Be warned that the build script may select a different compiler depending 
  on if there are other compilers available in `PATH`.
- (Only if you require a specific clang++ compiler) Set `GCCCOMPAT_CXX_COMPILER_FOR_MSVC` environment variable to 
  your GCC-compatible C++ compiler. For example
  ```powershell
  $env:GCCCOMPAT_CXX_COMPILER_FOR_MSVC="<LLVM install location>/bin/clang++.exe
  ```
  - If you want to make the environment variable permanent, run
    ```powershell
    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('GCCCOMPAT_CXX_COMPILER_FOR_MSVC', '<LLVM install location>/bin/clang++.exe', 'User
    ```

### Building steps

#### Environment set up

Ensure you have `cl.exe` in your path.
The easiest way is to use Visual Studio Developer PowerShell, though be careful that by default
VS Developer PowerShell selects 32-bit cl.exe.

To explicitly select 64-bit Visual Studio Developer PowerShell, one can use Visual Studio locator
alongside its developer shell script as

```powershell
$vsInfo = Get-CimInstance MSFT_VSInstance -Namespace root/cimv2/vs
& "$($vsInfo.InstallLocation)\Common7\Tools\Launch-VsDevShell.ps1" -Arch amd64 -HostArch amd64 -SkipAutomaticLocation
```

This prompt should put you in to 64-bit Visual Studio Developer PowerShell.

#### Configuring build files

There are multiple CMake presets available for building, depending on what you intend to build
- If you are building Asymptote for release with setup files, depending on how you would build `asymptote.pdf`,
  use either (see #documentation-generation section)
  - The `msvc/release` preset
  - The `msvc/msvc/release-with-existing-asymptote-pdf`
- If you are building only asymptote executable for release, or do not care about `asymptote.pdf`, use `msvc/release` preset
- If you are building Asymptote for development or debug mode,
  you are required to either create your own debug preset or configure cache variables manually.

Ensure that you are in the Visual Studio 64-bit PowerShell (or have every tool available in `PATH`), and run
```powershell
cmake --preset <your selected preset>
```

#### Building Asymptote

There are multiple key targets for building Asymptote.

- For the `asy.exe` executable and `base/` files, the target to run is `asy-with-basefiles`
- For documentation (depending on your configuration, including or excluding `asymptote.pdf`) - `docgen`
- If you are generating an installer file, the target `asy-pre-nsis-targets` builds all required components,
  excluding the GUI.
  See #building-gui-files for instructions on how to build GUI files.

The Asymptote binary is available
at `cmake-build-msvc/release/asy.exe` if using `msvc/release` or `msvc/msvc/release-with-existing-asymptote-pdf`
targets.
Instructions for generating a setup file are in the next section

##### Extra considerations for `asymptote.pdf`

On Windows, `asymptote.pdf` is built using MikTeX's `texify` program, hence why TeX Live cannot be used here.
Additionally, ensure that a replacement for `texindex` is available in the system.
As of the moment, I have only tested using WSL's `texindex`.

- If you have a WSL distribution with `texindex` installed,
that may be used as a substitute for `texindex` on windows. In this case, ensure the cache variable
`WIN32_TEXINDEX` is set to `WSL`. This is the default option.
- If you have a replacement `texindex` program, ensure `WIN32_TEXINDEX` points to that file.

## Building GUI files

### Dependencies for GUI files

All required dependencies for building GUI are present in `GUI/requirements.txt` and `GUI/requirements.dev.txt`.
We recommend using a virtual environment, for example

```powershell
python.exe -m virtualenv asyguibuild
./asyguibuild/Scripts/activate.ps1

cd <asymptote-repo>/GUI
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```

However, against our recommendations, the dependencies can be also installed into the system interpreter.

### Building the GUI files

The python script `GUI/buildtool.py` is used for building required files. To do this, run

```powershell
cd <asymptote-repo>/GUI
python.exe buildtool.py build
```

This should build all required GUI files.

## Installation file generation 

#### Prerequisites for installation file generation

Ensure that
- Requirements for building asymptote executable
- Requirements for building documentation (excluding `asymptote.pdf`)
- At least one of the following:
  - A pre-built `asymptote.pdf` file
  - Requirements for building `asymptote.pdf` file
- PowerShell. This should come pre-installed on windows.
  - Ensure that the ability to execute unsigned scripts is enabled
- Python 3 with relevant dependencies for building GUI files (This will be discussed in a separate section)

are present in the system.

#### If using a pre-built `asymptote.pdf`

Place `asymptote.pdf` in the directory `<asymptote-repo>/extfiles/`.
That is, the file `<asymptote-repo>/extfiles/asymptote.pdf` is present.
After that, configure cmake with the preset `msvc/release-with-existing-asymptote-pdf` - that is,

```powershell
cmake --preset msvc/release-with-existing-asymptote-pdf
```

#### If generating `asymptote.pdf` as part of build process

Use the `msvc/release` build preset for cmake.

### Building Asymptote install files

The cmake target `asy-pre-nsis-targets` should build everything on the `C++` side needed
for asymptote installation.

#### Generating the installer file

After building `asy-pre-nsis-targets`, install using CMake.
Note that this does not install into 
the program files directory, but rather, to a "local install root"
at `<asymptote-repo>/cmake-install-w32-nsis-release/`.

Due to how google test build files are written (as of currently), installing 
every component may result in an error (in particular, with `gmock.lib`).
This can be remedied by installing only the component needed for installer generation: `asy-pre-nsis`
To do this, run 

```powershell
cmake --install cmake-build-msvc/release --component asy-pre-nsis
```

After building all the required dependencies,
navigate to the directory `<asymptote-repo>/cmake-install-w32-nsis-release/`.
There, a script called `build-asy-installer.ps1` script is present.
Run that script.
It will prompt for the location of `makensis.exe` from the NSIS.
Specify the path to `makensis.exe`.

After this, the script should generate the installer file with the name `asymptote-<version>-setup.exe`.
This is the setup file ready for distribution.
