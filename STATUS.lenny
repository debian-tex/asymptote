STATUS of the texlive packages with respect to testing/lenny release
====================================================================
$Id$

* upgrade from TeX Live 2005 in etch

takeover of conffiles from passed away texlive-pdfetex

* xmltex etc

xmltex is missing, we should merge all the jadetex/xmltex/etc stuff
into texlive-htmlxml (maybe leave out jadetex/xmltex for lenny)

* various single package updates

irrelevant, if we find time we MAY do it
