- split .cfg file (otf section, linked script section, ...) and generate
  the parts
- create blacklist and links for otf fonts automatically or from a 
  list somewhere
- redo doc files linking process, move all into proper texmf dirs
  and link *into* /usr/share/doc, otherwise we are dying in the
  mktexlsr/mtxrun run
- links that are bin dir internal are currently generated via links.dist,
  but should be done somehow differently, best in upstream?

- get rid of the mapping directive, it serves 4 purposes at the moment:
  . ignoring a file: mapping;texmf[^/]*/doc/man/man5/synctex.5;;
    should be renamed to ignore or whatever
  . move: mapping;texmf[^/]*/doc/man/man(.*)/(.*);move;/usr/share/man/man$1/$2
    should be anyway done in a special way, maybe with a special
  . config-move: mapping;texmf[^/]*/xdvi/xdvi.cfg;config-move;/etc/texmf/xdvi/xdvi.cfg
    move the 3 files: dvipdfm/config/config, xdvi/xdvi.cfg, texdoctk/texdocrc.defaults
    to the /etc/texmf and create links from the original locations
    could be made separately
  . link: mapping;texmf/tex/generic/config/language.dat;link;/var/lib/texmf/tex/generic/config/language.dat
    create links for language.{dat,def,dat.lua} from main to /var/lib/texmf
    can be done in the .links file

  then simplify the whole tpm2deb-bin code since no remapping are done anymore.
