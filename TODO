- tex-common has /usr/share/texlive/texmf/... hard coded, we need a concerted
  updated with tex-common and texlive!!! >= 4.03 already prepared!

- need separate upload for context, too!!!!

- the scripts in /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/web2c/{tcfmgr,mkupdmap} etc
  are not executable!?!?!?! Why
    tpm2deb-source removes all x bits from all files under texmf-dist!!!
  for now I have disabled the chmod a-x on texmf-dist completely!!!


- otf font blacklists and links are generated from lintian files via
  scripts/create-tl-directives, but we do not reevaluate old blacklists
  and change locations
  somehow auto-generating that would be nice, how does lintian do that?
  Checking the contents files I guess?
- links that are bin dir internal are currently generated via links.dist,
  maybe take them from the linked_scripts/Makefile.am, rule
  	bin_links
  that gives the file:link association
  at least some automatic check would be nice.
