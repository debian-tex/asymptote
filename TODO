- split .cfg file (otf section, linked script section, ...) and generate
  the parts
- create blacklist and links for otf fonts automatically or from a 
  list somewhere
- redo doc files linking process, move all into proper texmf dirs
  and link *into* /usr/share/doc, otherwise we are dying in the
  mktexlsr/mtxrun run
- links that are bin dir internal are currently generated via links.dist,
  but should be done somehow differently, best in upstream?
