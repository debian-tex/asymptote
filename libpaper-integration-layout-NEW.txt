Integration of libpaper into dvips/dvipdfmx/xdvi/pdftex

General overview
================
* No files in under /etc/texmf are created or used
* the main distribution files in /usr/share/texlive/... are patched to include
  paper specific additional config files
* these paper specific config files are located in /var/lib/texmf/...
  by the libpaper hook

Details:
========

/etc/texmf files to be removed and purged from ucf:
	pdftex:		/etc/texmf/tex/generic/config/pdftexconfig.tex
	dvips:		/etc/texmf/dvips/config/config.ps
	dvipdfmx:	/etc/texmf/dvipdfmx/dvipdfmx.cfg
	XDvi:		/etc/texmf/xdvi/XDvi
original files to be patched:
	pdftex:		/usr/share/texlive/texmf/tex/generic/config/pdftexconfig.tex
	dvips:		/usr/share/texlive/texmf/dvips/config/config.ps
	dvipdfmx:	/usr/share/texlive/texmf/dvipdfmx/dvipdfmx.cfg
	XDvi:		/usr/share/texlive/texmf/xdvi/XDvi
generated files:
	pdftex:		/var/lib/texmf/tex/generic/config/pdftexconfig-paper.tex
	dvips:		/var/lib/texmf/dvips/config/config-paper.ps
	dvipdfmx:	/var/lib/texmf/dvipdfmx/dvipdfmx.cfg
	XDvi:		/var/lib/texmf/xdvi/XDvi
additional directives:
	pdftex:		\include (if exists?) pdftexconfig-paper.tex
	dvips:		cconfig-paper.ps
	dvipdfmx:	i dvipdfmx-paper.cfg
	XDvi:		#include XDvi-paper (???)


Coding changes:
* binaries DONE
  dvips included upstream
  dvipdfmx/xdvipdfmx needs patching from us (till now), patch prepared
  xdvi/pdftex by default

* libpaper.texlive-base DONE
  no changes necessary

* tl-paper and TLPaper.pm DONE
  changes in searching of which config file to use
  might be applied upstream, too?
  There is already support for something similar, but broken in TLPaper.pm. It uses
  %paper_config_path_component for the output, and if the respective entry is
  undefined, %default_paper_config_path_component. But we cannot changed
  the former by now. I will change that upstream to our %paper_config_path_component
  and let tl-paper use that, too.
  That fixes the writing part, but not the reading part. We should split tis
  into a our var that reads the files, too!!!

  TLPaper.pm changes committed to texlive-svn
  tl-paper updated

* postinst from texlive-base (or preinst)
  ucf clean all these files in /etc/ and remove them

* additional things to do DONE
  several tpm2deb.cfg drop directive most be disabled
