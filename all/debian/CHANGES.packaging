  * use see in texdoc for displaying of all types of files (Closes: #432037)

  * run the resurrect code only at upgrade, not install time. At clean install
    time there is no file in /u/s/texlive-{bin,base}/... [np]

2007-08-07
  * move the code to recreate missing conffiles from postinst to preinst:
    texlive-base: modes.mf
    texlive-base-bin: pdftexconfig.tex, config.ps
    texlive-latex-base: color/graphics.cfg

    #433889) [np]
    unfortunately version 2007-12 of texlive-bin ships a config.ps in
    /u/s/texlive-bin which is NOT equal to /e/texmf/dvips/config/config.ps
    in the same version. We fix this by applying a sed command that transforms
    the /u/s/texlive-bin/config.ps into the /e/texmf/d/c/config.ps of -12
    in the preinst of -13. After -13 is in testing we should remove this
    code.

        in rules.in

2007-06-02
  * beautify the config.ps installation [np] (see merge-dist-tree!):
    - remove the code in rules.in
    - move config.ps from texlive-bin/debian/ to 
      texlive-bin/debian/texlive-base-bin.root/usr/share/texlive-bin
  * strip the ./debian/$pkg part in debian/all/generate-license-file [np]

2007-05-31

    tetex-base may happen any time.

2007-05-30
  * IMPORTANT: Move the #DEBHELPER# string after the $maintscript.post
    snippet.  "post" now signifies that it is after the usual,
    tpm2deb-bin.pl-generated config file handling, not that it is after
    the debhelper stuff.  I need some code at this special place, and
    furthermore I think it's usually a bug in tex-common if something is
    not handled in a dh_installtex snippet, but cannot be done before it.
  * Fix the copying of conffiles to /usr/share/$sourcepkg: New directive
    "config-copy-move".
  * Add missing dep of libkpathsea-dev on libkpathsea4

2007-05-29
  * Ship modes.mf and pdftexconfig.tex in /usr/share/$sourcepackagename,
    and install it into /etc/texmf in postinst.  For the time being, do
    that without debconf messages and unconditionally (configure would
    fail without them, anyway). [fk]
  * Recreate tpm2liclines
  * tex-common package-status in bug.control, since "report-with" doesn't
    supply that information

2007-05-26
  * texlive-bin: don't install libkpathsea.la (Closes: #426006) [np]
  * all/texlive-bin: do not actually carry out the "preserve deleted
    conffile" due to the tetex bug and too many busted installations.
    We warn the admin to delete the file if he really wants to.

2007-05-21
  * texlive-common conflicts with all package revisions of all packages 
    << latest-revision as set in tpm2deb.cfg.
  * big format move:
    - move (partly fixed) format.{tex,pdftex,etex,metafont} to texlive-base
      and edit format.latex.cnf in texlive-base. Fixes done:
      . add pdfetex to format.etex.cnf
      . add latex to format.latex.cnf
      . remove those two from format.pdftex.cnf
      . take unchanged format.tex.cnf
    - BuildFormat executes moves:
      . remove call in texlive-bin/bin-{tex,pdftex,etex,metafont}.tpm
      . add call {tex,pdftex,etex} to plain.tpm (and thus to texlive-base)
      . add call metafont to metafont.tpm (and thus to texlive-base)
    - missing: should we take over fmt.d/10texlive-base-bin.cnf? I prefer
      to leave it there and don't do anything. After we have this version
      without a conf file we can add code for the upgrade from 2005.
  * as a consequence of the format move some cleaning actions:
    - remove /usr/bin/mf -> mf-nowin as generated from dh_installtex in
      texlive-base rules, mf is shipped by texlive-base-bin
    - remove also /usr/bin/{pdf,}etex in texlive-base rules, and create
      them via dh_link in texlive-base-bin

2007-05-20

  * common.functions.preinst: rework the xdvi conf file handling code
    to not "preserve removal" when upgrading from older texlive versions
    (Closes: #425272)

2007-05-19
  * add stricter dependencies to all packages: if in the final shipout
    dep on a texlive package there is no version given, the value of
    latest-version (from tpm2deb.cfg) of the source package is taken.
    (texlive-bin: Closes: #421969) (texlive-lang: Closes: #423143)

  * add new poppler patch: 30_libpoppler_new, the old is still present
    for backports, this also adds a versioned build dep for
    libpoppler-dev (>= 0.5.4) to texlive-bin
  * texlive-extra-utils suggests gs-* for epstopdf (Closes: #423988)

2007-05-16
  * texlive-bin: dpkg_md5sum in common-functions.preinst returns now
    the empty string in case of an unknown conffile (could have been
    created by touch). This should fix Ubuntu bug 111654. [np]
    Serious testing whether nothing else is broken should be done.
  * merge manually the changes from the libkpathsea branch back [np,fk]
    - change rules.in to build libkpathsea4 and -dev, and add the necessary

2007-05-14
  * texlive-base: texlive-full should not depend on tetex-base

2007-04-28
  * texlive-bin: patch updmap so that the help text at map file not found

    gcc, thanks to Falk Hueffner <falk@debian.org> (closes: #419434) [fk]
  * create meta packages texlive-lang-all in texlive-lang, thanks to
    Frans Pop for the suggestion. [np]
  * texlive does not longer depend on context [np]
  * we build texlive-lang-arab, this needs a new .orig.tar.gz as we have
    to include the respective files there. [np]

    in case it is present (closes: #419381) [fk]
  * Remove any format or log files in /var/lib/texmf/web2c, they must be
    in $engine subdirs now.  teTeX does not properly remove them, and
    they cause strange failures with context (see #419059 and #418976) [fk]

    (thanks to LoÃ¯c Minier for the hint!)

2007-04-12

2007-04-05
  * texlive-bin: replace links of odvicopy.1 and odvitype.1 to the respective
    man pages without o with a minimal manpage (Closes: #417274) [np]

  * fix installation of info pages, we should believe perl if it tells us
    Variable "@SpecialActions" will not stay shared at 
    debian/tpm2deb-bin.pl line 343. [np]

  * big do_remap_and_copy restructuring: the final component now is 
    unified for all mapping directives: either relative file names (in this
    case /usr/share/texmf-texlive is prepended), or absolute file names.
    Needs loads of testing. Furthermore, the sub-directives names have
    changed (remap -> move). Proper documentation added in trunk/README [np]

2007-03-23
  * texlive-bin: fix config file move logic for xdvi.cfg (Closes: #415906) [np]

  * final changelog editing

2007-03-15
  * move nag.sty to a TEXINPUTS tree [fk] 
  * modularize the make_deb function in tpm2deb-bin.pl (ongoing work) [fk]

2007-03-14
  * Add code to take over changes from fmt.d/10texlive-pdfetex in
    texlive-base-bin. 

2007-03-12
  * Let tl-bin Build-Depend on tex-common (>= 1.2) for the handling of
    fmtutil-sys in postrm [FK]
  * Fix the "when to run" logic for conffile moves, and write them in a
    way that I actually understand them myself

2007-03-09
  * Fix conffile upgrade code: Only act with correct versions, actually
    pass the action parameter to the function, and respect conffile
    removals [FK]

2007-03-08
  * Add error-unwind code for the conffile renames [FK]

2007-03-02
  * upgrade path replaces:
    - texlive-latex-base -> texlive-base-bin << 2007 since 
      /usr/bin/pdflatex has moved
    - texlive-base-bin -> tetex-bin (<< 2007)
    - texlive-metapost -> tetex-bin (<< 2007)
  * fix forgotten config files handling

2007-03-01
  * introduce a new map sub-directive config-remap
  * remap instead of copy various files into /etc/texmf (dvips/config/config.*
    texdoctk, xdvi)
  * texdoctk.dat is not a configfile anymore
  * fix fmtutil patches referring to pdfetex as engine

2007-02-28
  * use old teTeX's xdvi perl script, add a dependency base-bin -> perl [NP]
  * create links via dh_installtex and remove the links.dist entries [NP]
  * depend on tex-common >= 1.1 to get dh_installtex with link creation [NP]

2007-02-18
  * add common.functions.preinst and include common.functions.$type in
    the make_maintainer call. We don't want to have the preinst code
    hanging around in all other maintainer scripts.
  * use dh_installtex in the rules files, thus cleaning the 
    maintainer scripts:
    - rules.in: use dh_installtex
    - tpm2deb.cfg: bump tex-common deps to >> 1.0 for the flavor
      format:build_all
    - tpm2deb-bin.pl: rewrite make_maintainer()
    - remove empty common.functions as all the functionality is taken from
      dh_installtex
  * as an interim solution, add format links to the respective binary
    packages' dh_link files [FK]


2007-02-17
  * add patch 01_tmp_configure_without_installextra which allows to skip
    running updmap-sys, fmtutil-sys, mktexlsr and most importantly
    texlinks with a configure option; add that option [FK]
  * Add explicit real packages to the build-dependencies, in addition to
    the alternative virtual packages [FK]

2007-02-16
  * fixes from the first test round
    - really blacklist ttf2pk, this is a perl regexp, not a shell wildcard,
      so we have to use .* instead of * (should be done in texlive-old!, too)
    - missing (upstream) dependency
      texlive-humanities -> texlive-latex-base
      texlive-science -> texlive-latex-base
    - add conflict texlive-common <-> texlive-chemistry as this is gone
    - mathpazo hack
      mathpazo was in math-extra <= 2005-2, in latex-recommended << 2007,
      and now in fonts-recommended, thus:
      texlive-fonts-recommended replaces texlive-math-extra (<= 2005-2)
      texlive-fonts-recommended replaces texlive-latex-recommended (<< 2007)
    - HA-prosper was moved from latex-extra to latex-recommended, thus
      add a versioned replace
    - all/debian/preinst.pre code: upgrading to tetex-bin 2007 does not 
      work as the "upgrade from experimental versions" breakage kicks in.
      check for upgrade from version 2005 <= version <= 2005-2
      so that tetex-bin 3.0-something is not hit

2007-02-15
  * update dvipdfm patch [NP]

2007-02-14
  * Another mapping directive "copy" which is like config-copy (see
    below) but does not create any maintainer scripts entries. [NP]
  * Adapt tpm2deb.cfg that new config files are just "config" [NP]
  * add preliminary config file handling, no unroll treatment by now [NP]
  * fix texlive-bin build breakage, we patch the Build script now [NP]

2007-02-13
  * Expand infrastructure to allow automatic generation of preinst
    code for config files. Config files are marked in the tpm2deb.cfg
    via a mapping;origdist;config-{copy,link};dest directive and
    in the preinst script of the respective package a line
    	handle_config_file $configfile
    is added. Currently prefixed with a :, as the function has to be
    written [NP]
  * define the files from Frank's list as config files [NP]

2007-02-12
  * Add Replaces: for file that were in tl-latex-extra in TL 2005 and
    are now in individual collections [FK, probably earlier unnoted
    changes by NP]
  * Use separate configure and build targets in tl-bin's rules and
    Build.debian, for easier work with the sources [FK]
  
2007-02-08
  * add new remapping type "configfile" which is copied to the last
    argument as base path and remains where it should be. [NP]
  * conflict with texlive-pdfetex, and add necessary replaces

2007-02-06
  * TL2007 work [NP]
    - collection-chemistry is gone, superseeded by collection-science
      do not build texlive-chemistry and let tl-science replace tl-chemistry
    - add replaces: texlive-humanities and tl-science -> tl-latex-extra

2007-01-25
  * more internal restructuring [NP]

2007-01-22
  * lots of internal changes to the Perl scripts, mainly cleanup, more
    descriptive names, and debugging handling [FK]
  * Add Tpm.pm and FileUtils.pm from TL 2007 [FK]
  * Switch texlive-base and texlive-bin to quilt 
  * Do not install rules.in in the binary package, it not used and hence
    is confusing. 
  * Switch texlive-lang, texlive-doc to quilt [NP]
  * include quilt call only for packages with patches [NP]
  * update tpm.data to the data of TL2007

2007-01-11
  * all: change the build infrastructure so that short and long
	description of add-on packages can be specified in the
	configuration file [FK]
  * all: add a versioned build-dep on findutils, sarge's doesn't
	understand the -wholename option.  Should be dropped when etch is
	released, nobody is going to want to make backports for
	oldstable. [FK}
  * no texlive-context anymore, replace it with Debian context package
	
2007-01-11
  * texlive-base: blacklist siam as it is non-free, thus new upstream 
    (Closes: #406426) [NP]

2007-01-08
  * texlive-base: create transitional packages tetex-bin and tetex-extra [FK]

release texlive-bin 2005.dfsg.2-10

2007-01-11
  * build -10 from the old repository layout. The old layout will continue
    for etch support.

release texlive-bin 2005.dfsg.2-9

2007-01-04
  * texlive-bin: Apply a patch by "Mark A. Wicks" <mwicks@kettering.edu> to

2007-01-02
  * texlive-bin: Apply patch by Julian Gilbey <jdg@debian.org> to prevent 
    mktexlsr from creating ls-R in root's home directory (closes: #402925)

release texlive-bin 2005.dfsg.2-8
release texlive-base 2005.dfsg.2-5
release texlive-extra 2005.dfsg.2-4

2006-12-28
  * move to new repository layout, documentation has to be written for it
 
2006-12-18
  * texlive-bin: reinclude pslatex script and its manpage into
    texlive-base-bin. [NP]

2006-12-15
  * all: move the dpatch stuff to addons-per-source/$package/debian/patches

2006-12-14
  * texlive-extra: remap infix-RPN.tex and .sty from the doc hieracy to 
    texmf-texlive (Closes: #402987) (closes Ubuntu bug #69690)
  * texlive-bin: move bin-ttfutils to tl-font-utils, blacklist everything
    but ttf2afm, add bin-ttfutils.tpm and ttf2afm.1 to the source
    package (Closes: #402983) (Closes ubuntu #75545)
  * all: restructure the layout of addons-per-source, it is now one directory
    per source plus one for all, which is cp -a to the source package
    at source package build time. This way we can include files missing
    in the .orig.tar.gz without making a new .orig.tar.gz. This was necessary
    to fix the above as bin-ttfutils.tpm was missing.
    Note that binary files are NOT dealt with ATM, so do NOT install
    binary files into addons-per-source/ !!
  * redo a bit of documentation in the README file

    depends to suggests. Default would be recommends, but a suggests is
    enough. (Closes: #399064) [NP]
  * Add the ability to define additional execute statements in the config
    file [NP]
  * texlive-extra: add the missing dstroke.map, and add the addMap action
    to the config file (Closes: #400780) [NP]
  * tpm2deb.pl/texlive-base: Don't add mktexlsr calls to the postinst/postrm
    script of texlive package, as it does not contain 'real' files

  * upgrade pgf in texlive-pictures to 1.01 for compatibility fixes

2005-11-24 NP
  * Close the ITP (Closes: #312897)
  * add a dependency tl-htmlxml -> tl-latexrecommended because jadetex
    needs the ecrm fonts.
  * switch to texmf-texlive tree, which also makes a dependency on
    tex-common >= 0.12 necessary.

2005-11-22 NP
  * this release was uploaded as -1 to experimental but rejected. Thus
    the release was renamed as -0.2 and a new -1 will be generated.

2005-11-21 NP
  * fix lintian source override installation

  * remove the 04TeXlive hack as the change will go into tex-common 0.11
    rather soon
  * remap only a few config files (those for programs) to /etc/texmf/texlive
  * try to fix the conundrum with format generation. This is a complete
    upstream chaos (ok, also upstream I created the chaos ;-). Should be fixed
    rather soon.

2005-11-20 NP
  * fix invocation of grep in common.functions to add || true, since grep
    returns if no match found
  * fix installation of TeXlive.cnf as 04TeXlive.cnf into /e/t/texmf.d
  * add a overriding TEXMF variable to 04TeXlive.cnf which includes
    TEXMFCONFIG without !! (Should actually be fixed in tex-common!)

  * add a distribution entry to the ChangeLog file and make tpm2deb.pl
    aware of it

    significantly speeding up the initialization time at source-deb
    building time.
  * add additional override for texlive-langgerman that german is correct

2005-11-15 NP
  * fix the man page errors (wrong char and ttf2pt1)

2005-11-14 NP
  * remove build-dep on tex-common
  * Rework maintainer script handling, separate out the creation of
    maintainer scripts into a function, allow only to create the
    maintainer scripts for checking.
  * move the extra format configuration from the snippets/post scripts
    to tpm2deb.cfg.
  * Building a first prerelease version. The scripts used are from
    svn revision 134.

    missing.

2005-11-09 NP
  * Don't forget dh_strip

2005-11-08 NP
  * Fixes for big cleanup part I.
  * Create all rules file from tpm2deb.pl, make the rules subdir
    unnecessary.

2005-11-07 NP
  * Big cleanup in the script, part I.
    - make config file syntax more readable
    - create infrastructure for all kind of tests by reading in all tpm
      data and store it in a hash
    - separation of functions handling with tpm data, config file reading
      and hash creation from the debian functions
    - work on more packages in one go is now possible, thus the tedious
      reading of all the tpm files is not necessary anymore

2005-11-05 NP
  * TeX live 2005 is done. It includes everything up to perforce change #8640.
  * Make a new set of tpm/licence files
  * allow independent building of orig.tar.gz files
  * do not create empty control files

version 2004.05.10.13-1 UNRELEASED Thu, 13 Oct 2005 22:44:33 +0200

    - packages which are not included at all
      (missing for bin-* packages)
  * Include antt and iwona only in texlive-fontsextra and not in 
    texlive-langpolish.

2005-10-06 NP
  * change cm-super from Suggest to Depend, as it is now in Debian/sid

2005-10-04 NP
  * remove last traces of texlive-trees and replace it by Master
  * Fix postrm scripts to take actions only on remove action, not
    on purge

2005-09-29 NP
  * Move to svn://svn.debian.org/pkg-texlive/texlive/trunk/
  * split tpm2deb from Master, include the Tools perl modules in orig.tar.gz

2005-09-27 NP
  * Add mktexlsr patch to generate ls-R via a /tmp file and cat into
    the original one. This way permissions can be set for the ls-R files.
    Taken from tetex-bin.

2005-09-26 NP
  * Changed cmd test to which from test -e, so that no actual paths
    are used in the control scripts (Debian Policy)

version 2004.05.09.25-1 UNRELEASED Sun, 25 Sep 2005 12:03:18 +0200

2005-09-25 NP
  * Change the test for fmtutil-sys --byhyphen to fmtutil-sys --listcfg
    and grep for ^latex.
  * Remove the chmod -x stuff, it breaks execution of various web2c/*
    scripts (mktexupd, tcfmgr, ...)
  * Switch to new numbering scheme (tlversion.yy.mm.dd) where tlversion
    is the last *released* TeX live version and yy.mm.dd is the current
    date. This way we can have regular releases 200N-debrelease and 
    additional releases between official TeX live releases.
  * Fix the order of ifs in postrm scripts so that first the existence of
    fmtutil-sys is checked, and then wether the latex fmt is installed.
  * Add myself to the Uploaders field.
  * New source version, including up to perforce change #8177

2005-09-24 NP
  * Forget to remove the "all" from the generated rules file. It does
    not hurt at build time, but I don't like it.
  * add the fmtutil-sys --byhyphen calling check also to the postrm scripts
  * remove x bit from all files under texlive-trees at source packages
    built time

2005-09-23 NP
  * Fix the lang postinst scripts so that fmtutil-sys --byhyphen is only
    called if language.dat is found. This is not the optimal method, but
    the best I can think of ATM.
  * Actually copy source and not source.development from the depot
  * make the architecture parameter to tpm2deb unnecessary and put config
    for this into the tpm2deb.cfg file. Update all the debian/rules files.
  * Change Maintainer to: 
    Debian TeX live Maintainers <pkg-texlive-maint@lists.alioth.debian.org>
  * Added some documentation to tpm2deb.pl, and cleaned up the script

version 2005.09.15-2 UNRELEASED Wed, 21 Sep 2005 16:59:23 +0200

2005-09-20 NP
  * Move the link /usr/share/texmf/fonts/map -> /etc/texmf/map from
    texlive-basic to texlive-basicbin as in the later there are several
    map files and updmap is also in basicbin
  * Temporary fixes to the tpm files to make texlive-lang* with hyphen files
    depend on texlive-latex and not only on texlive-basic.
  * Add (unused) feature to build debian packages for single CTAN packages
    as well

version 2005.09.15-1 UNRELEASED Thu, 15 Sep 2005 16:14:10 +0200

2005-09-15 NP
  * New source version, including up to perforce change #8062
  * fixed format generation problem
  * make descriptions lines not longer than 80 chars

2005-09-14 NP
  * add -e to the /bin/sh shebang for error checking in the control scripts
  * test for existence of various programs before trying to execute them
    this is for the case when a package is removed but not purged, but
    the tex-common package is removed, too.

version 2005.08.27-1 UNRELEASED Sat, 27 Aug 2005 16:03:44 +0200

2005-08-27 NP
  * New source version, including up to perforce change #7870
  * fix build dependency on libXaw7-dev | libXaw8-dev
  * Fix generation of formats of texlive-basic. The actual fmt.d files
    are in texlive-basicbin, but the .ini files are in texlive-basic,
    so actually the call to fmtutil should be in the postinst of
    texlive-basic. (Thanks to LUK ShunTim)

2005-08-26 NP
  * Do not include cm-super.tpm, but suggest the debian package cm-super,
    which contains the full set of cm-super fonts. For now locally
    available on tug.

2005-08-25 NP
  * Fix installation of README.Debian-source into all binary packages

version 2005.08.24-1 UNRELEASED Wed, 24 Aug 2005 18:10:02 +0200

2005-08-24 NP
  * Everything is build with depot at change #7842
  * Really fix the info problem: Now all the info files are converted at
    install time to unix line endings. Thus also the strange ^M in the
    postinst script install-info commands should be fixed.

2005-08-23 NP
  * New source version, including up to perforce change #7836
    This includes fixed versions of pdftex, mpost, dvipdfmx, and as usual
    several updates to  (La)TeX packages.
  * fixes the dvips.info install problem
  * lm is now included in texlive-basic, so changed conflicts in tpm2deb.cfg
  * generation of /var/cache/font/* and various ls-R files has moved to
    tex-common (>= 0.7), thus also the changed Depends
  * Dependency on tex-common (>= 0.7) also fixes the lambda with all
    languages problem in dumping the format file

2005-08-22 NP
  * Include the included packages and their title in the long description
    of the control files, and generate the control files automatically.

version 2005.08.21-1 UNRELEASED Sun, 21 Aug 2005 16:20:00 +0200

2005-08-21 NP
  * New source version, including up to perforce change #7781
  * Fix missing dependencies in Depot, should make install/deinstall more
    clean, and give a full install.
  * Building the source packages does not need the file revision anymore,
    all information are deduced from this ChangeLog file

version 2005.08.18-2 UNRELEASED Sat, 20 Aug 2005 22:35:00 +0200

2005-08-20 NP

2005-08-18 NP
  * Split out texinfo building into its own (source)package.
  * More work on the doc disaster.

2005-08-16 NP
  * Fix info installation again. blacklist now really disables *all*
    actions, also specials, while empty mappings allow special actions.
    So the info files from info are blacklisted, all the others are
    remapped to void and dh_installinfo-ed.

2005-08-12 NP
  * Fix syntax error in postrm when no actions are defined

2005-08-11 NP
  * Fix install-info installation
  * Fix dh_installinfo/dh_compress order in rules, update rules files for
    arch=all
  * do not call updmap-sys, fmtutil-sys, update-XXXX in postrm upgrade
    . /usr/share/doc/pkgname/...
        contains the actual files
    . /usr/share/doc/texmf/
        contains some directories and some symlinks to directories in
        /usr/share/doc/pkgname (as I said, hope this works, will
        implement it now and see ;-)
    . /usr/share/texmf/doc -> ../doc/texmf

2005-08-10 NP
  * Add support of info files with dh_installinfo
  * do not install tpm files and fmtutil/* files into /usr/share/texmf
  * put DocFiles back into /usr/share/texmf/doc, but make links of
    every file to /usr/share/doc/debname/...
    Hopefully texdoc is working now.
